# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various **machine learning algorithms**, developed primarily for learning, experimentation, and reference purposes. The focus is on understanding the core logic behind each algorithm rather than relying solely on high-level libraries.

## 📌 Objectives

- Implement fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch
- Understand mathematical foundations and algorithmic workflows
- Provide clear, modular, and well-documented code
- Serve as a reference for beginners and practitioners

- Algorithm-specific explanation

## 🧠 Algorithms Covered

### Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

### Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
